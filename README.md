# qjump-tc
QJump Traffic Control Module - The heart of QJump

To build, run "make" in the source directory. Make sure that you have kernel headers installed.

To use, run with optional paramters decribed below. eg:

    sudo insmod sch_qjump.ko verbose=4

The kernel module supports several paramters. 
- verbose (int):    (in the range 0-4) which varies how verbose the module output is
- bytesq (int):     sets the number of bytes per epoch. This is the "P" parameter from the QJump equation
- timeq (int):      sets the time (in microseconds) per epoch. This is the result of the QJump equation. 
- pXrate (int):     sets the the "f" value for QJump level X. Value is set as an integer multiple of the base rate given by bytesq/timeq. For example, setting p2rate to 5 indicates that the third highest priority level (p2) will receive 5x the number of bytes per epoch the highest prioirty (p0).
- autolass (bool):  turns on the "autoclassifier" which degrades an application until it reaches the right QJump level

To check that the module has inserted properly use dmesg. eg: 
```

After inserting the module, you can bind qjump to an ethernet port using TC. eg:  

    sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root qjump

You can then check that the module is working e.g:
```
$ dmesg  
[ 2519.047377] QJump[4]: Jump[4]: Delaying 279940 cycles per network tick (99us)  
[ 2519.047382] QJump[4]: Queue 0 = @ 10Mb/s   
[ 2519.047383] qjump[4]: Init fifo limit=128  
[ 2519.047384] Bands= 1  
```

To remove as a TC module:  

    sudo tc qdisc del dev eth0 root qjump
